Suffix for the file name .sz:  size of the matrix (arcs, sommets, composantes).cd: description of a state.Rii: matrix stored in sparse format, row by row, row index increasing column index increasing .Cii :  matrix stored in sparse format, column by column, row index increasing column index increasing .pi : a vector of probabilityDescription IMPORTANT : NOTE that the first state has index 0. .sz : 3 lines : first line : number of arcs (non zero transitions)second line, number of rows and columns in the matrix (only one if the matrix is squared)third line : the number of ocmponents in the multidimensionnal Markov chain(1 if you create the chain by another program).cd : one line per state: first the state number, then the value for each componentin the multidimensionnal Markov chain.Rii : one line per row, first the state number, then the output degree of the state, then for each transition the probability and the destination. .Cii : one line per column, first the state number, then the inout degree of the node, then for each transition the probability and the origin. .pi : a probability per line.
